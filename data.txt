Maybe I'm just trippin', but the truth is I'm in pain (I am)
I just need a getaway
I can feel the reaper comin', know he want me in my grave
All But 6 'til I lay

"They told me "heavy is the head that wears the crown
Which is why I'm always looking down, looking like I'm always down, 
ay/Another year, another clown, another round, another down
Another grave I dug, another stain that's on my Gucci gown

The devil told me never take a trip down memory lane
I claim insane and blame the game for making me drained and stained
I was brought here just so I could screw up and then die
